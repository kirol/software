As I have tried to tell people before, there is a paste bug in Notepad++, and Notepad++ adds "?" character to pasted text.

Try this and see for yourself. Go to any youtube video, and then highlight and copy the entire text message posted by someone. Then paste it into a notepad++ text file and notice that "?" characters will appear randomly in the text.

But interestingly, some text pasts OK, but some add a random ?

So try a few different comments and copy and paste them.





Just make sure Notepad++ it's encoding is not set to ANSI Sticking out tongue
With ANSI you're bound to get question-marks for any 'special' character.
